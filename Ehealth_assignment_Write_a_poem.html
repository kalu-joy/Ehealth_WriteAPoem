    <h1>A SONNET LETTER</h1>
    <p> Dear sunshine <br>
        You once walked these paths <br>
        You know the distance, if you do the maths <br>
        Emerging with marks and bruises <br>
        maybe taken for a ride, not cruises <br>
        This I tell you<br>
        there's always something new<br>
        These paths are still not without holes<br>
        But the good thing! There are lights shinning from poles<br>
        revealing a true heart<br>
        not punching pins at you like a dart. <br>
        Oh! This twelveth line of my letter<br>
        I skip the thirteeneth to say now - not later,<br>
        I LOVE YOU SUNSHINE.<br>
        <br>
        By Israel Akpan.
